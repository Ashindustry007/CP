    All primes are of the form 6k ± 1, with the exception of 2 and 3.
    This is because all integers can be expressed as (6k + i) for some integer k and for i = ?1, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4; 2 divides (6k + 0), (6k + 2), (6k + 4); and 3 divides (6k + 3).
    So a more efficient method is to test if n is divisible by 2 or 3, then to check through all the numbers of form 6k ± 1.
